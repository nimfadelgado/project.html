   <p class="description">Greetings, I'm Nimfa. I'm a student at BSIT. Well, a website created that default introduction for me based on my preferences and interests. So who exactly am I? My all time favorite question. I don't hate anything or anybody. I passionately learn new things until I master them. Very light hearted and sportive person. Iâ€™m one of those people who is a brilliant listener but at the end of the day does things finally what please my heart and feels right to me anyways. According to me... if nobody is against you, then you are doing something very boring. I am the only person in this entire world I would love to know thoroughly. I believe life is too short to be serious all the time, so if you cannot laugh at yourself... call me.. Ill do it for you :p.</p>
